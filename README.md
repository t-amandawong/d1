cmpm 120 first project
Requirements met:
1. 3 distinct visual scenes: Intro Scene, Loading Scene, and Ending Scene
2. 2 audio assets: 'woosh' sound effect in Intro scene, and background noise in Ending scene (both recorded by me on iPhone Voice Memos)
3. 2 image assets: Studio logo image (made by me in Adobe Illustrator) and game title image in Intro scene, both with transparent background
4. 2+ geometric shapes: 3 circles in Loading scene (rendered in-engine using the Phaser graphics class)
5. 1 big fancy text: Game title image in Intro scene (font found on Google fonts, edited by me in Illustrator)
6. 1 multi-line text: Outro text in Ending scene (rendered in-engine using this.text)
7. 1 fading scene transition: Fade to a dark grey in Loading Scene
8. 1+ object motion animation: Many object animations in both Intro Scene and Loading scene (using Phaser.tweens)

Additionally, I used a custom font in some of my text objects, which was loaded in my index.html file.
